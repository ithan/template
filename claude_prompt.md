  Guide for .content-grid 
  -----------------------
  Define .content-grid on the parent element of your content.
  This will create a grid layout with a max-width of --content-max-width.
  By default, anything inside the grid will have a max-width of --content-max-width.
  If we use the class .breakout on an element, it will be a bit bigger, since it will include the --breakout-size.
  If we use the class .full-width on an element, it will take the full width of the viewport.

  If you need to change the breakout size or padding
  Just change the variables in the parent element where you want to apply this layout, and it will be applied to all children.

This are the alias:
alias: {
    $components: './src/lib/components',
    $lib: './src/lib',
    $stores: './src/lib/stores',
    $styles: './src/lib/styles',
    $utils: './src/lib/utils',
}

   
These are the basic rules:

Svelte Structure:
- Use <script lang="ts"> on top, content in the middle,  <style lang="postcss"> at the bottom.
- Implement prop validation with TypeScript.  
- Use this syntax for props interface: interface $$Props extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> { ... }
    - Note: You will need: import type { HTMLAttributes } from "svelte/elements";
- Utilize Svelte's reactive declarations and stores when appropriate.
- For complex components, consider breaking them down into smaller, reusable parts.
- Use {#key} blocks to optimize list rendering.

HTML:
- Must be clean, semantic, and readable.
- Use modern HTML5 tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>.
- Implement structured data using microdata or JSON-LD where appropriate.
- Use <details> and <summary> for expandable content.
- Implement <dialog> for modal windows.
- Use appropriate ARIA roles, labels, and attributes.
- Comment each section properly.
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6).

Accessibility:
- ARIA roles, alts, titles, event listeners, easy tabulation, and focus actions are mandatory.
- Implement keyboard navigation support.
- Use appropriate color contrast ratios.
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content.
- Aim for AAA WCAG compliance where possible. 100% lighouse score is the minimum. AA is the standard.

Component Design:
- Components must be as reusable as possible.
- Implement prop validation and default values.

JavaScript/TypeScript:
- Use TypeScript for all scripting.
- Implement modern coding practices, including comments, readability, and error handling.
- The user has the right to know when something goes wrong. So don't hide errors under console.log. Display them in the UI.
- Use modern JavaScript features like destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals.
- Use native fetch for API calls, and use Signal when needed.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- When creating single components, types can be in the same file. For more complex types, suggest creating a types file.
- Try to create some default demo data for the components, so it can be tested easily.
- For demo images provide image from https://picsum.photos/ with the same aspect ratio as the image you want to use.
- Performance and readability are key and more important then fancy code.

General:
- Ensure components are accessible, color-blind friendly, reader-friendly, SEO-friendly, and secure.
- Implement responsive design principles.
- Avoid having to many props in a component. 3 prompts where 2 are JSON objects is better then 6 prompts.
- When adding images, do it with lazy loading, referrerpolicy set to no-referrer, and with a proper alt tag.

CSS:
- Use the latest features when possible, with fallbacks for older browsers if needed.
- Utilize CSS variables (custom properties) extensively.
- Implement animations, but disable them for users who prefer reduced motion.
- Utilize modern layout techniques:
  - CSS Grid with named grid areas
  - Flexbox with explicit grow, shrink, and basis values
  - CSS subgrid where appropriate
- Implement logical properties (e.g., margin-block-start, padding-inline-end)
- Use modern viewport units (lvh, svh, dvh) for responsive layouts
- Implement container queries for component-based responsive design
- Utilize :has() for parent selectors where appropriate
- Implement aspect-ratio property for maintaining proportions
- Use modern color functions like lch(), lab(), and color-mix()
- Implement scroll-snap for scroll-based interactions
- Use the custom content-grid layout in the parent elemenets, then if any element needs to be at the breakout or full-width, use the classes .breakout or .full-width.
Example:
\```
    <root class="content-grid"> <!-- Never add the classes breakout or full-width here -->
        <div>item is inside container</div>
        <div class="breakout">item is a bit bigger</div>
        <div class="full-width">item is full width</div>
    </root>
\```
- Use clamp() for fluid typography and spacing
- Implement CSS nesting for cleaner, more maintainable styles
- Utilize @layer for better specificity management
- Implement @supports for progressive enhancement
- Use modern text features like text-wrap: balance and hanging-punctuation
- Implement backdrop-filter for visual effects
- Use :focus-visible for improved focus styling
- When talking about styles, its better to use CSS over JS. If JS is needed, try to use CSS variables to control the styles and not JS directly.
- All images should include aspect ratio



When using grid, use named grid areas. When using flexbox, avoid flex: 1 shorthand; instead, use:
flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: auto;
And adjust these values based on specific needs.


Good practices:
- Unless specified otherwise, encourage the user to create clean, semantic, and accessible code.
- If a component can be logically split into smaller, reusable parts, suggest this approach to the user.
- Proactively recommend standardized components for common UI elements. For example:

  "I've noticed you're using some recurring UI patterns. We could enhance reusability with something like:
  
  <-- components/ui/Element.svelte -->
  // Provide a clean, reusable implementation with variants and Tailwind CSS classes
  
  Would you like to see your original request refactored using this approach? (We can also proceed with your initial implementation if you prefer.)"

- Also provide the folder structure to make it maintainable if appropiated.
- Always provide the solution the user explicitly requested first. Then, unless instructed otherwise, suggest and share examples of a cleaner, more maintainable implementation.
- Recognize that preferences for 'cleaner' implementations can vary. Don't hesitate to ask for the user's opinion on coding style, naming conventions, and architectural choices.
  For instance, some users may prefer snake_case over camelCase, or stores over reactive declarations.
- In the absence of specific user preferences, default to code that prioritizes cleanliness, maintainability, and readability.
- When suggesting improvements or alternatives, frame them as options rather than corrections. This approach respects the user's expertise while offering valuable insights.
- Be prepared to explain the benefits of suggested patterns or components, focusing on aspects like reusability, consistency, and ease of maintenance.


And this is the task:
